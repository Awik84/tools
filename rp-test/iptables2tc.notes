[... is the commment in iptables today, in the form
-m comment --comment "{\'usage\': \'VIDEO\', \:q'session_time\': \'2019-04-18T15:36:29.861361\', \'session_id\': \'9d7cc74d-7e97-519c-b6e6-e40626ed0750\'}"
which is not supported in TC. So, if this is something that is used, we need to find a different way to do that

----> PreRouting (eth1) -> dport == 12026 -> DNAT(10.8.169.17:47998)  => Linux Forwarding => eth0 (SNAT) -> 10.0.20.5:<sport>, 10.8.169.17:47998

With TC this translates to:
==========================
1. filter on eth1 for dst port 12026
2. action: DNAT to 10.8.169.17:47998
3. action: SNAT to 10.0.20.5
4. decrement TTL
5. action: modify src MAC to that of 10.0.20.5 anddst MAC to that of the default router on the private side

6. filter the packets coming back (via connection tracking)
7. action : DNAT to CLIENT_IP:CLIENT_DST_PORT (via connection tracking)
8. action: SNAT to 24.51.15.230 (via connection tracking)
9. decrement TTL
10. action: modify src MAC to that of 24.51.15.230 and dst MAC to that of the default router on the public side


Which means we need to :
======================
1. Manage the connection tracking - which was done implicitly by iptables
2. Provide Forwarding information (MAC address of default router/ game seat) - which was done by linux stack

Managing Connection tracking:
============================
We'll use 2 Connection tracking zones for this.
Zone 2  : For packets coming from the external client / public (this will initate the VIDEO session)
Zone 3  : For packets coming from the Gameseat / private side (this will be the response)

(We could have used 1 Zone, but that is a bit tricky since TC doesn't allow us to use SNAT and DNAT in the same
rule)

The flow looks like:
===================						Zone 2.
						+-------------------------------+
			(1)			|new: dnat(10.8.169.17:47998)(7)|
public side => start tracking in Zone 2 ->	|est: dnat	(3)		| -> clear CT state -> start tracking in Zone 3
						+-------------------------------+ 				|
												Zone 3		|
												+-----------------------+
												|new: snat(10.0.20.5)(4)|
												|est : snat	(4)	|
												+-----------------------+
													|
												modify src and dst MAC
													|
													V
						Zone 3						    Game Seat
						+---------------+
			(2)			|		|
private side -> start tracking in Zone 3->	|est: dnat(5)	| -> clear CT state -> start tracking in Zone 2
						+---------------+					|
												Zone 2	|
												+---------------+
												| est: snat (6)	|
												+---------------+
													|
												modify src and dst MAC
													|
													V
												  external client


Which means we have 2 set of flows:
==================================
Static flows upfront:
1. To track packets coming from the public side
2. To track packets coming from the private side
3. To dnat (zone 2) established flows from the public side
4. To snat (zone 3) (new and est) flows going to the private side
5. To dnat (zone 3) established flows coming from the private side
6. To snat (zone 2) flows going to the public side

Dynamic flows per VIDEO session
7. To dnat (zone 2) new flows from the public side based on the destination port.

Forwarding notes
=================
Since the TC rules modify the source and destination MAC address on both sides, we need
1. the MAC address of the default router on the public and private side.
2. If the default router changes, then the MAC address in all the existing rules needs to
   change.
